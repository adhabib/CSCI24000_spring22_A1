My name is Adeel Habib, and I am a freshman majoring in computer science

My only experience with anything related to computer science comes from my 
first semester which I just completed. I'm in this class because it is required
for my major, so yeah. Something interesting about myself is that I had no 
idea about what major I wanted to go into, until I applied for college. I love 
cars, so in the future one of my dreams is to own a nice collection of my 
favorite cars. i would also like to give back in any way I can. I've recently 
started listening to Polo G, his music is cool.
